# Feature Ideas

## Visual/Animation Improvements

* \[ ] More unique tilesets for each dungeon type
* \[x] "No active dungeon" screen should have a one-click button to start next dungeon

## Elite Mobs

* \[x] Elite enemies with distinct health bars and more attacks
* \[x] Spawn among regular enemies in higher level dungeons
* \[ ] Unique health bars for elite mobs

## Boss Enhancements

* \[x] Unique boss for each dungeon zone's pinnacle level
* \[x] Show pinnacle boss on dungeon progression screen

## Stats

* \[ ] Track healing received (healing IN) per hero

## AI/Combat Improvements

* \[ ] Rogues with bows should either have ranged attacks or bows removed from rogue item pool
* \[ ] Nerf XP gains when hero level is higher than dungeon level

## Endgame Progression

* \[ ] Gear score progression: after max character level, gear drops with gear score as next progression path
* \[ ] Endgame skill tree with more nodes and passives (Diablo paragon-style)

## Prestige System (Spitball Ideas)

* \[ ] After level 30, prompt prestige
* \[ ] All classes have prestige classes (Paladin → Angel, Rogue → Assassin, etc.)
* \[ ] Prestige classes start at level 1 but base stats = base class level 30 stats
* \[ ] Prestige classes have unique skill trees and equipment
* \[ ] Monsters scale from previous run (prestige level 1 = effective level 31)
* \[ ] Second prestige introduces gear score and paragon board
* \[ ] Paragon board is HUGE, takes multiple runs to max out (but maxing is possible)
* \[ ] Monster levels scale forever
* \[ ] Gear score persists and scales even after prestige/level reset
* \[ ] Gear score keeps heroes viable at fresh level 1 in new runs
