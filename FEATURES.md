# Feature Ideas

## Visual/Animation Improvements
- [ ] More unique tilesets for each dungeon type
- [x] "No active dungeon" screen should have a one-click button to start next dungeon

## Elite Mobs
- [x] Elite enemies with distinct health bars and more attacks
- [x] Spawn among regular enemies in higher level dungeons
- [ ] Unique health bars for elite mobs

## Boss Enhancements
- [x] Unique boss for each dungeon zone's pinnacle level
- [x] Show pinnacle boss on dungeon progression screen
- [ ] Final bosses need 3-4 unique drops each
- [ ] All wing bosses should drop uniques

## Unique Items
- [ ] Need more unique items
- [ ] Uniques need their own rarity color
- [ ] Display unique item effects on item screen (currently not shown anywhere)

## Bestiary
- [ ] Track unique/pinnacle bosses in the bestiary
- [ ] Enhance raid boss bestiary

## Progression Gating
- [ ] Auto-run button should be visible but disabled before unlocking

## Stats
- [ ] Track healing received (healing IN) per hero

## AI/Combat Improvements
- [ ] Monster balance pass
- [ ] Rogues with bows should either have ranged attacks or bows removed from rogue item pool
- [ ] Nerf XP gains when hero level is higher than dungeon level

## Endgame Progression
- [ ] Gear score progression: after max character level, gear drops with gear score as next progression path
- [ ] Endgame skill tree with more nodes and passives (Diablo paragon-style)

## Prestige System (Spitball Ideas)
- [ ] After level 30, prompt prestige
- [ ] All classes have prestige classes (Paladin → Angel, Rogue → Assassin, etc.)
- [ ] Prestige classes start at level 1 but base stats = base class level 30 stats
- [ ] Prestige classes have unique skill trees and equipment
- [ ] Monsters scale from previous run (prestige level 1 = effective level 31)
- [ ] Second prestige introduces gear score and paragon board
- [ ] Paragon board is HUGE, takes multiple runs to max out (but maxing is possible)
- [ ] Monster levels scale forever
- [ ] Gear score persists and scales even after prestige/level reset
- [ ] Gear score keeps heroes viable at fresh level 1 in new runs
